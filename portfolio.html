                <h2>Academy Portal (PHP with Slim, JavaScript, MySQL)</h2>
                <p>We worked with two other student development teams on a legacy codebase - the iO Academy portal where academy admins can follow an applicant's journey through application stages. Our Scrum team first worked on fixing two existing bugs, and then built functionality to lock applicant stages to prevent deletion and make the portal safer to use. We also worked on improving the usability of an option select modal, making it clearer to the user where in the process an applicant currently is and what stage is next. The project was built using the PHP framework Slim using the MVC pattern, and used namespacing and autoloading in line with PSR-12. We unit tested with PHPUnit and used Git for version control.</p>

                <h2>Aptitude Test (React)</h2>
                <p>Working in React, my team rebuilt a legacy project previously written in TypeScript - the aptitude test for new applicants at iO Academy. We fetched the data for the test using an existing RESTful API and built the front end to display the questions and answers using the React-Bootstrap component library. We used the useEffect and useState hooks to keep an eye on the score as the applicant answered the questions. The applicant also had the ability to skip a question and come back to it later. Once the test was submitted the applicant’s score was calculated and sent as a POST request to update the database. We used Git for version control.</p>

                <h2>Muppet App (PHP/MySQL)</h2>
                <p>OOP project following SOLID principles, we built a PHP application for displaying information about a range of muppets on the front end. We used the Hydrator pattern to retrieve data from a MySQL database, and created functionality to search and generate a random muppet. We built error handling and wrote unit tests where possible. I particularly enjoyed creating the app architecture and working on the search functionality for the project. </p>

                <h2>Snake Sweeper (JavaScript game)</h2>
                <p>I worked as part of a Scrum team to build a custom minesweeper-esque JavaScript game. The user was able to select the size grid to play on, as well as how many ‘mines’ to find. We built functionality to validate user input and then programmatically generate the board with randomised hit boxes. Using event handlers, a modal displayed on hit or miss. We built a ‘lives left’ counter and on finishing the game, the user was presented with the opportunity to play again with a new randomised deck.</p>
